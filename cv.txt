RESEARCH
INTERESTS

I focus on software and system security, especially on automated vulnerability detection
through fuzzing and the implementation of advanced bug sanitization techniques. My
research includes fuzzing for hardened Android applications and compiler-based sanitizer
optimization. I am currently extending these studies to broader system environments.
